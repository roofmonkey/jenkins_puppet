This is a puppet module for jenkins setup for our glusterfs - hadoop build server, it automates installation of puppet and disabling firewalls. 

It can also be used to setup VMs, etc, for development and testing of gluster.

In order to use it:

mkdir /etc/puppet
cd /etc/puppet/

yum install git
git clone this repository

yum install puppet

Note that there might be some lines of puppet script you have to coment out of the jenkins module for alpha/omega stuff.  

Then daemonize the puppet service or apply it manually: 

/usr/bin/puppet apply $(puppet config print manifest)

ARCHIVA: NOT YET PUPPETIZED

To install archiva, simply copy the repository information into a fresh archiva aquired by wget. 
Then, you will want to update the port it serves on , and run bin/archiva start.
